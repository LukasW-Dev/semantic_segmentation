## Semantic Segmentation in Densely Vegetated Environments

This repository provides an implementation of a semantic segmentation pipeline tailored for challenging, densely vegetated environments such as forests. 
It leverages a pretrained [Mask2Former](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Mask2Former) model to perform robust segmentation of natural terrain and vegetation structures. 
In addition, parts of the model code and utilities are adapted from the [WildScenes](https://github.com/csiro-robotics/WildScenes) repository developed by CSIRO Robotics, 
which focuses on semantic understanding of wild and unstructured outdoor environments.

For the pretrained model please refer to the website of WildScenes
